Add beautiful tips, warnings, notes, and callout boxes to your WordPress posts and pages in seconds.

== Description ==

AlertsDLX offers beautifully styled alerts, callouts, and notification boxes for Gutenberg (the Block Editor), Full-Site Editing (FSE), the Classic Editor, or anywhere blocks and shortcodes are supported, including most page builders.

This plugin is a clean and modern timesaving solution to quickly adding customizable alerts, with a focus on being lightweight and user friendly.

Coupled with a free plugin like <a href="https://blockvisibilitywp.com/">Block Visibility</a>, your imagine can really go wild. For example, you can create an "Empty Cart" alert for WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads when a cart is empty. Create dismissible alerts for site-wide notices, or per-page notifications that can be dismissed.

= Does AlertsDLX work with shortcodes? =

Yes, via the <a href="ttps://docs.dlxplugins.com/v/alertsdlx/shortcode-usage">built-in shortcode</a>.

= Does this work with the Block Editor (aka, Gutenberg)? =

Yes, AlertsDLX comes with four blocks, one for each style of alert (Bootstrap, Chakra, Material, and Shoelace). The blocks are fully featured, and are native to the block editor.

= What alert styles does the plugin support? =

* <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-alert/">Material UI</a>
* <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/alerts/">Bootstrap</a>
* <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/alert">Chakra UI</a>
* <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a>

= Can I create dismissible notices? =

Yes, each alert can be dismissed, and can be set to expire after a certain amount of time. For example, create a terms of service alert on the homepage that can be dismissed, with the expiration lasting a week.

= Where are the admin settings? =

There are no admin settings for this plugin. Please use the included blocks or shortcode to output the alerts notification.

= Can I use custom colors? =

Yes, you can customize the colors via the shortcode or built-in blocks by selecting "Custom" as a block style.

= Can I use my own custom SVG icons? =

Yes. The icon picker allows you to enter an SVG. For the shortcode, you must supply your own SVG.

= Can I use my own custom images? =

Yes. It's recommended to use a square image, and there is a built-in cropper available. Custom images look best center-aligned.

= Does AlertsDLX work on Multisite? =

Yes. There are no admin options, so there's nothing to configure on a network.

= Can I show alerts on specific posts or pages? =

AlertsDLX can be used in conjunction with free plugin <a href="https://blockvisibilitywp.com/">Block Visibility</a> to display a notification under certain conditions. While AlertsDLX in itself is not a site-wide notification tool, it can be used as one if put in a global template such as with FSE.

= Does the plugin support countdowns? =

AlertsDLX does not support countdowns or auto-expiration. If you need an alert to auto-expire, I suggest using it with <a href="https://blockvisibilitywp.com/">Block Visibility</a> and setting a date-based visibility setting.

= Can I disable the custom font used (Lato)? =

Yes, you can improve performance further by disabling the custom font supplied with AlertsDLX and supplying your own. Please see <a href="https://docs.dlxplugins.com/alertsdlx/developers/how-to-use-and-disable-custom-fonts-in-alertsdlx">disabling custom fonts in AlertsDLX</a>
